# Enviorment Testing
Phase 2 is all about testing in our environment. As Phase 1 was about deployment and getting our build correct phase 2 is about getting our existing users into Jamf. We are still going to need to conduct tests from deployment but most of that has been done so far. Here you will find an outline of the goals of phase 1 along with a timeline for completion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals
The plan is to create a separate issue for each of these topics so we can track them. I might even make milestones. We will go into further detail on the issues and would appreciate feedback on them.
- Get at least one user from each department to test Jamf.
  - Define what test looks like.
  - Have a mix of remote and office users if possible.
  - look at all scenarios.  
  - We will need to test different scenerios of enrollment.
  - Applications that are installed pre Jamf and how that affects the scoping post enrollment.

- Collect data on features of Jamf and how we can better serve our users
  - Send out google survey or something that we can use to survey different parts of Jamf. Just some rough ideas of topics include:
    - Self Service
    - Jamf Being installed
    - Policies being ran

- Define success for test. i.e what is the measure of success? 

Goal will be to have widespread deployment by .
