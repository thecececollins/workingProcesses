# LDAP Integration is Planned

Associated Milestone: Plan LDAP Integration

## Summary
Scoping in Jamf is difficult without having manually created Jamf users or a directory to pull from. One of the key deliverables is to implement a directory. 

## The Plan
#### *Under Construction!*
- What are ALL of the benefits to having a directory in Jamf? Why is this a good thing? What will it change? 
- What is the process for integrating a directory into Jamf?
- How will a directory change our current scoping? 
- What other risks are associated with changing from our current setup to a directory based Casper environment? 
- Identify possible employee groups for scoping.
