# Ticketing and Workload Process is Defined

Associated Milestone:

## Key Deliverables in this Milestone
- 

## The Rules

- Each success criteria is a key deliverable and will be a separate Milestone in Github.
- In 2016, GitHub issues tagged to these milestones are the priority. All other issues will be untagged.
- Work will be done in 2 week intervals called, "Sprints."
- Work assignments will be done during the Bi-weekly Casper meeting, which marks the end and start of each Sprint.
- The primary owners of Casper (@ben and @ty) will have a Scrum meeting every morning for 5-10 minutes to discuss the project.

## Scrum Meetings

- Occurs every morning at 9am.
- Should be about 5 - 10 minutes long.
- State what you worked on yesterday, what you will be doing today, and if you need help with anything.
- Purpose is to increase accountability, improve communication, and eliminate the need for lengthy weekly meetings.
- In the IT area
- For owners of the project

## Bi-Weekly Team Meeting

- Occurs twice a month.
- Review the previous 2 week Sprint - update on the work completed, blockers, issues.
- Plan the next 2 week Sprint - review backlog of work, prioritize issues, assign tasks for the next two weeks.
- Compose a summary of progress to update the rest of the team during IT Sync.
- Miscellaneous agenda items.
- Open to the team.

## 2 Week Sprints

- Sprints are two weeks long.
- The "backlog" of issues in the are reviewed and prioritized during the Bi-Weekly Team meeting.
- Issues are assigned to team members for the two week period based on current priority and how much work can be done during that two week period.
- Issues being assigned to the next Sprint will be tagged with "Sprint."
- Once the 2 week Sprint is planned and in place, it should NOT be changed. Work should not be added unless the agreed upon work was finished early.
- For any issues that were not completed during the previous Sprint, they can be rolled into the next Sprint or put on hold due to a major blocker or if something else takes a higher priority.
- We will not tag any issues with "Sprint" unless someone is assigned a task. We want to be inclusive to the rest of the team but we can't assign priority items to individuals that are not able to commit on the project/Casper. All other untagged GitHub issues can be cherry picked at any time.
- The purpose of conducting work in two week Sprints is to be long enough to complete complex tasks, but short enough to be flexible for shifting priorities. It forces a continual review of current priorities while also allowing a focused two week work period.
